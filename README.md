## Projects
### Automatic Disc Herniation Segmentation and Classification Using Deep Learning Models on Lumbar Spine Magnetic Resonance Images
[Project](https://github.com/EmmanuelAguagwa/Automatic-Disc-Herniation-Segmentation-and-Classification/tree/main)

Disc herniation is a common spinal disorder that can cause back pain and other related symptoms. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of disc herniation are critical for patients' quality of life. However, manual diagnosis of disc herniation can be time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Therefore, the development of an automated tool that can accurately segment and classify disc herniations can greatly assist medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
