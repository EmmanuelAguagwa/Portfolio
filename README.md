#### Technical Skills: Tools: PostgreSQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn), Excel, Power BI, Azure, Github

## Hello :)
I come from a data science background with a Master’s in Applied Data Science, and I’ve built my experience around making complex information easy to understand and useful in real situations. I’ve worked with statistical modelling, machine learning and data visualisation, using tools like Python, SQL and cloud-based analytics to solve problems and support decision-making. I enjoy collaborating with different teams, breaking down challenges and turning raw data into insights that actually drive results.

Outside of data, I’m passionate about photography. It’s my way of slowing down, noticing details and experimenting with creativity. That same eye for detail and appreciation for structure shows up in how I approach data projects. Whether I’m analysing patterns or capturing moments through a lens, I’m always looking for the story beneath the surface.

## Projects
### Automatic Disc Herniation Segmentation and Classification Using Deep Learning Models on Lumbar Spine Magnetic Resonance Images
[Project](https://github.com/EmmanuelAguagwa/Automatic-Disc-Herniation-Segmentation-and-Classification/tree/main)

Disc herniation is a common spinal disorder that can cause back pain and other related symptoms. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of disc herniation are critical for patients' quality of life. However, manual diagnosis of disc herniation can be time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Therefore, the development of an automated tool that can accurately segment and classify disc herniations can greatly assist medical professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.


### Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning
[Project](https://github.com/EmmanuelAguagwa/Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning)

I built a machine learning project focused on predicting stroke risk using real patient data. The goal was to support early intervention by identifying high-risk individuals before a medical emergency occurs. The dataset contained records from 5,110 people and was highly imbalanced, which made the modelling process more challenging and meaningful.
I followed the CRISP-DM workflow from start to finish. This included exploring the data, handling imbalance, engineering useful features and testing several models. After comparing performance, the XGBoost classifier delivered the strongest results and became the final choice for prediction.

The project highlights how data science can support clinical teams by turning complex health data into practical insights. It also shows my ability to manage real-world data issues, evaluate models properly and build solutions with clear impact.

### Facial Recognition Attendance System
[Project](https://github.com/EmmanuelAguagwa/Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System/tree/main/Face%20recognition%20attendance)

This project is a real-time attendance system that identifies individuals from live camera footage and automatically records their attendance. It uses a full computer vision pipeline that detects faces, generates embeddings with deep learning models and matches them against a stored database. The system was built using Python, machine learning techniques and OpenCV, with a focus on operating reliably in dynamic CCTV-style environments.
The workflow includes face detection, alignment, feature extraction, similarity matching and attendance logging. It handles challenges like lighting changes, movement, multiple faces and partial occlusions. The system is designed to run with low latency, maintain accurate recognition and store secure logs for auditing and analysis. It also incorporates considerations for privacy, data security and real-world deployment.
This project demonstrates how computer vision and deep learning can automate tasks like attendance tracking while maintaining accuracy, speed and reliability in real-time conditions.
